🚀 **Project Description: Image Caption Generation**

📌 **Overview:**
The "Image Caption Generation" project combines the power of deep learning with Python, Flask, and LSTM networks to automatically generate human-readable captions for images, bridging the gap between visual content and natural language.

🎯 **Objective:**
Our goal is to create a system that understands image content and produces descriptive captions, a task traditionally reserved for human cognition.

📅 **Project Phases:**
- 🧠 Ideation: Understand stakeholders and brainstorm solutions.
- 🏗️ Design: Propose solutions, create architecture, and define data flow.
- 📊 Planning: Choose the tech stack and create a project plan.
- 🛠️ Development: Implement features, optimize code, and handle exceptions.
- 📈 Performance: Test the model and prepare final deliverables.

💻 **Technologies:**
- Python: Core language for deep learning and web app.
- Flask: Web framework for the user interface.
- LSTM: Key for image understanding and caption generation.

🔍 We are currently in the initial stages, and as the project progresses, we anticipate groundbreaking results in image caption generation.
